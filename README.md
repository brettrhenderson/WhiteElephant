# WhiteElephant
Random number generator for the Paci group annual white elephant gift exchange

Couldn't have our annual white elephant gift exchange in person this year, so we needed an 
alternative way to generate the order of selecting gifts besides drawing names from a hat.
This site should do just that. Beware easter eggs and the moving background eating up 
more processing power than it should.
